# intonation_analysis

This is the code that allows the reproducibility of the main results exposed in my Master Thesis on Intonation Analysis in the context of Violin Education.


You will find the main functions developed to implement this project in order to arrive at the results demonstrated in Chapter 4:
- Note segmentation and processing (trimmingpeaks_short_note_segmentation.ipynb)
- The vibrato model (vibrato_model.ipynb)
- Note clustering ( ms_clustering_wohlfhart.ipynb & looking_for_short_long_border_clusters.ipynb)
- Intonation deviation from 12-TET heatmaps for both short and long notes (intonation_heatmaps_short&long_notes.ipynb)
- Intonation deviation from 12-TET heatmaps for both short notes regarding backwards and forwards direction (intonation_direction_analysis_heatmaps.ipynb)

In the main_functions folder you can find the functions that were developed throughout the project and that have applied through the different files.
