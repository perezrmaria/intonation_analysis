# intonation_analysis

This is the code that allows the reproducibility of the main results exposed in my Master Thesis on Intonation Analysis in the context of Violin Education.


You will find the main functions developed to implement the note segmentation and processing of the project, as well as code corresponding to the vibrato model, the note clustering and intonation deviation from 12-TET heatmaps for both short and long notes, regarding backwards and forwards direction in order to arrive at the results demonstrated in Chapter 4.

In the main_functions folder you can find the functions that were developed throughout the project and that have applied through the different files.
